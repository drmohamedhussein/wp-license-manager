# WPLM Development Log - 2024-07-30 10:30:00 UTC

This log tracks the progress of bug fixes and feature implementations for the WP License Manager (WPLM) plugin.

## Project Summary:

The WP License Manager (WPLM) plugin aims to be a robust, bug-free, and feature-rich WordPress licensing management system. It is designed as a full alternative to Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) licensing, with deep integration with WooCommerce, a built-in CRM/ERM system, and a licensing system similar to Elite Licenser.

Key features and objectives:
-   **Automated Licenser System:** Allows users to upload a plugin/theme zip, inject licensing logic, and generate a licensed version. This includes: 
    -   Robust file upload and extraction with validation and error handling.
    -   Plugin/theme detection and metadata parsing from uploaded zip files.
    -   Identification of the main plugin/theme file for code injection.
    -   Programmatic injection of WPLM API licensing templates.
    -   Generation and injection of code for a self-hosted update mechanism.
    -   Packaging modified files back into a new zip and providing a download link.
    -   Ensuring temporary files and directories are properly removed.
-   **WooCommerce Integration:** Deep integration with WooCommerce for product and license management.
-   **CRM/ERM System:** Built-in customer relationship management and enterprise resource management functionalities.
-   **Elite Licenser-like System:** A comprehensive licensing system with advanced features.

## Conversation Summary:

Our previous interaction focused on the complete implementation and refinement of the **Automated Licenser System** within `class-automated-licenser.php`. Key steps completed include:

1.  **Implemented core logic** in `ajax_upload_and_process`.
2.  **Refined file upload and extraction** with robust validation (file type, size limits) and error handling, including Zip Slip vulnerability protection.
3.  **Implemented plugin/theme detection** and metadata parsing for uploaded zip files.
4.  **Identified the main plugin/theme file** for code injection.
5.  **Programmatically injected a WPLM API licensing template**, refining injection logic for both plugins and themes.
6.  **Generated and injected code for a self-hosted update mechanism**, ensuring correct constant definitions.
7.  **Packaged modified files** back into a new zip and provided a download link, with correct handling of the root directory within the zip.
8.  **Ensured temporary files and directories** are properly removed in all scenarios.

All tasks for the Automated Licenser System have been marked as **Completed**.

## Current Focus:

-   **Addressing errors in `class-enhanced-admin-manager.php`.**
-   **Performing a comprehensive project review** to identify and fix any remaining bugs or critical errors to ensure the WPLM plugin is production-ready.
