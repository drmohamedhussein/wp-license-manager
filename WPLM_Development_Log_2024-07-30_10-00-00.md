# WPLM Development Log - 2024-07-30 10:00:00 UTC

This log tracks the progress of bug fixes and feature implementations for the WP License Manager (WPLM) plugin.

## Initial State:

- **Project Goal:** Create a robust, bug-free, and feature-rich WordPress licensing management system (WPLM) as an alternative to Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) licensing, with deep WooCommerce integration, a built-in CRM/ERM system, and a licensing system similar to Elite Licenser.

- **Current Focus (as of 2024-07-30 10:00:00 UTC):** Implementing the "Plugin/Theme Detection and Metadata Parsing" functionality within the `ajax_upload_and_process` method of the `class-automated-licenser.php` file.

## TODO List:

1.  **Implement the core logic of the Automated Licenser System in `ajax_upload_and_process` within `class-automated-licenser.php`.** (Completed)
2.  **Refine file upload and extraction with robust validation and error handling.** (Completed)
3.  **Implement plugin/theme detection and metadata parsing for uploaded zip files.** (Completed)
4.  **Identify the main plugin/theme file for code injection.** (Completed)
5.  **Programmatically inject a WPLM API licensing template.** (Completed)
6.  **Generate and inject code for a self-hosted update mechanism.** (Completed)
7.  **Package modified files back into a new zip and provide download link.** (Completed)
8.  **Ensure temporary files and directories are properly removed.** (Completed)
