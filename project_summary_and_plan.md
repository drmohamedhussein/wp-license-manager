# WP License Manager - Project Summary and Development Plan

This document summarizes the work completed, outlines the remaining bugs and errors from the user's report, and details the next steps for development.

## 1. Work Completed

### 1.1 Project Understanding & Setup
- Read all files from `wp-license-manager` directory and various markdown files (`DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`, `WPLM_Project_Summary.md`) to gain a high-level understanding of the project structure and previous development efforts.
- Created `activity_log.md` to keep a running log of all actions and progress during this development session.

### 1.2 Product Management Page - License Counts
- Investigated the "Product Management Page mismatch between active and total licenses."
- Successfully identified and corrected the display of "Total Licenses Generated" and "Total Activations" in `wp-license-manager/includes/class-admin-manager.php` using `sed`.

### 1.3 Licenses Page - Generate Key Investigation
- Investigated the "Add New License - Generate Key" bug.
- Discovered that the `ajax_generate_key` function in `class-admin-manager.php` was calling a non-existent method: `WPLM_Automated_Licenser::generate_unique_license_key()`.
- Located the actual license key generation logic in `wp-license-manager/includes/cli.php` within the `wplm_generate_standard_license_key()` function.
- Gathered content for `cli.php` and `class-admin-manager.php` to perform a manual file replacement due to persistent issues with `edit_file` and `sed` in the PowerShell environment.

## 2. Outstanding Issues and Bugs

Based on the user's report and the current state of the codebase, the following issues still need to be addressed:

### 2.1 Product Management Page Issues
- **WooCommerce Product Link:** The WooCommerce product link is not showing/syncing correctly. (Initial attempts to fix this were cancelled due to tool limitations).
- **Product Synchronization:** Products with the same name in WPLM and WooCommerce are not differentiating or syncing as expected.

### 2.2 Licenses Page - Generate Key
- **Core Functionality:** Ensure the "Generate Key" button correctly generates a unique key and automatically sets it as the post title. (Currently in progress with the file replacement workaround).

### 2.3 Subscription Menu
- **"Create Subscription" UI/UX:** The "Create Subscription" button does not redirect to a new page; instead, it shows a small, unusable popup. Fix CSS and redirection.

### 2.4 Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Page
- **"Add Customers" Functionality:** Clicking "Add Customers" has no action. It should create a customer profile with details (username, first name, last name, country, mobile, social media links, products, licenses, subscriptions) and sync with or without WooCommerce customers.

### 2.5 Activity Log
- **Empty Log:** The activity log is still empty even after adding licenses, products, and customers. The logging functions need to be checked and fixed.

### 2.6 Export and Import Feature
- **Functionality Breakdown:** The feature is not working, redirects to an empty page, and crashes the website. It should generate an Excel file.

### 2.7 Add/Bulk Licenses - Product Selection
- **Improved UX:** Implement AJAX search for product selection instead of a simple dropdown to improve usability.

### 2.8 Generate Licenses from WooCommerce Orders
- **Error Scanning Orders:** Fix the "Error scanning orders" bug and "No data available" issue in the Analytics Activity Report.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Complete "Generate Key" Fix (High Priority):**
    - Construct the new content for `wp-license-manager/includes/class-admin-manager.php`, incorporating the `generate_unique_license_key()` method and updating its call.
    - Overwrite the original `class-admin-manager.php` with the new content using a robust file operation (e.g., Python script for temporary file and `mv`).
    - Remove the `wplm_generate_standard_license_key()` function from `wp-license-manager/includes/cli.php`.
    - Update `activity_log.md` with the completion of this task.

2.  **Revisit Product Management Page Issues:**
    - Develop a new strategy for modifying PHP/HTML files to ensure the WooCommerce product link displays correctly and product synchronization is resolved. This may involve more direct file manipulation if `edit_file` continues to be unreliable.

3.  **Address Remaining Bugs Systematically:**
    - Work through the remaining issues listed in Section 2, starting with the "Subscription Menu - Create Subscription Issues." Each fix will involve:
        - Investigation of relevant code.
        - Developing and applying a solution.
        - Updating `activity_log.md`.
