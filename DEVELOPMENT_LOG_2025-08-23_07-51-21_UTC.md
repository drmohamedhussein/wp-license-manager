## **2025-08-23_07-51-21_UTC - Started Working on WPLM Plugin Enhancements**

**Objective:** Continue fixing existing bugs and errors in the WPLM plugin and implement the Automated Licenser System.

**Completed Tasks:**
- Implemented plugin/theme detection and metadata parsing for uploaded zip files in `class-automated-licenser.php`.
- Identified the main plugin/theme file for code injection.
- Implemented `parse_plugin_data` and `parse_theme_data` functions to extract metadata.
- Integrated detection and parsing logic into `ajax_upload_and_process`.
- Implemented the core logic for injecting the WPLM API licensing template, including dynamically retrieving `wplm_api_url` from settings and replacing placeholders for `product_slug`, `product_version`, and `item_id`.
- Generated and injected code for a self-hosted update mechanism.
- Packaged modified files back into a new zip and provided a download link.
- Ensured temporary files and directories are properly removed.
- Added an input field for `item_id` to the automated licenser form and integrated its value into `ajax_upload_and_process`.

**Current Task:** Refining file upload and extraction with robust validation and error handling (client-side validation).

**New Completed Tasks:**
- Implemented client-side validation for file upload (checking for selected file and .zip extension) and item ID (checking for a valid number greater than 0) in `automated-licenser.js`.
- Added appropriate error messages for client-side validation failures.
- Added `invalid_item_id` string to `wplm_licenser.strings` in `class-automated-licenser.php` for localized error messages.

**Next Steps:**
- Perform a linter check on modified files to identify and fix any newly introduced errors.
- Conduct a full code review of all changes made during this session to ensure robustness and prevent fatal or critical errors.
