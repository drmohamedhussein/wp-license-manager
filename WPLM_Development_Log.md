# WPLM Plugin Development Log

## Project Goal
The user's primary goal is to create a robust, bug-free, and feature-rich WordPress licensing management system called WPLM. This plugin should serve as a full alternative to Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) and its licensing features, integrate deeply with WooCommerce (while also being able to work standalone), include a built-in CRM/ERM system, and have a licensing system similar to Elite Licenser. It must also support WooCommerce-style subscription licensing (like WooCommerce Subscriptions and EDD Recurring), avoid critical errors, and provide a smooth UI/UX.

## Key Technical Concepts
- **WordPress Plugin Development:** Hooks (actions, filters), Custom Post Types (CPTs), Meta Boxes, AJAX handlers, WP-CLI integration, REST API, nonces, capability checks, input sanitization, output escaping.
- **Licensing Management:** License key generation, activation/deactivation, activation limits, expiry dates, license statuses, domain validation, fingerprinting, remote kill switch, security incidents logging, rate limiting, license types.
- **E-commerce Integration:** WooCommerce integration for products, orders, and subscriptions.
- **Subscription Management:** Built-in subscription system, WooCommerce Subscriptions integration, cron jobs for renewals and expiry checks, renewal reminders.
- **CRM/ERM:** Customer CPT, customer data syncing with WooCommerce, activity logging, communication log, customer import/export.
- **Internationalization:** Text domain loading.
- **Error Handling & Debugging:** `WP_DEBUG`, `WP_DEBUG_LOG`, `dbDelta`, `wp_die`, `error_log`, `try-catch` blocks, `WP_Error`.
- **PHP Features:** `ZipArchive` class, dynamic properties (PHP 8.2+ deprecation), `hash_equals`, `random_bytes`.
- **Performance:** Efficient database queries, caching (transients).

## Issues and Resolutions

### Issue 1: `Error calling tool: Missing/invalid required arguments: 'target_file' (string)`
- **Description:** Initial tool call failed due to missing `target_file` argument.
- **Resolution:** Corrected the tool call by providing the `target_file` argument.

### Issue 2: `Error calling tool: No changes were made to the file.` (Repeated)
- **Description:** Occurred when attempting to modify `remove_custom_capabilities()` in `wp-license-manager.php` and when removing `class_exists` checks or adding `return` statements in `class-api-manager.php`.
- **Resolution:** Self-corrected by realizing capabilities were already present or checks/returns were not needed, re-examined code, and updated task status.

### Issue 3: `PHP Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function add_query_var() in .../class-enhanced-digital-downloads.php:147`
- **Description:** `add_query_var()` was called too early, leading to a fatal error.
- **Resolution:** Removed `add_query_var()` from `setup_rewrite_rules()` and added a new public method `register_query_vars($vars)` to handle query variable registration via the `query_vars` filter. The `add_filter('query_vars', [$this, 'register_query_vars']);` call was added to the constructor of `WPLM_Enhanced_Digital_Downloads`.

### Issue 4: `PHP Notice: Function _load_textdomain_just_in_time was called incorrectly.`
- **Description:** `load_plugin_textdomain()` was called too early.
- **Resolution:** Moved the `load_plugin_textdomain()` call into a public method `load_plugin_textdomain_wplm()` and explicitly hooked this method to the `init` action in `wp-license-manager/wp-license-manager.php` with a default priority. (Note: This notice persists but is not critical).

### Issue 5: `PHP Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: call_user_func_array(): Argument #1 ($callback) must be a valid callback, cannot access private method WP_License_Manager::load_plugin_textdomain_wplm()`
- **Description:** The `load_plugin_textdomain_wplm()` method was `private`.
- **Resolution:** Changed the visibility of `load_plugin_textdomain_wplm()` to `public` in `wp-license-manager/wp-license-manager.php`.

### Issue 6: `PHP Deprecated: Creation of dynamic property WPLM_Enhanced_Digital_Downloads::$payment_gateways is deprecated`
- **Description:** PHP 8.2+ deprecation warning due to dynamic property creation.
- **Resolution:** Explicitly declared the `$payment_gateways` property in the `WPLM_Enhanced_Digital_Downloads` class.

### Issue 7: `PHP Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: call_user_func_array(): Argument #1 ($callback) must be a valid callback, class WPLM_Enhanced_Admin_Manager does not have a method "ajax_activity_logs"`
- **Description:** AJAX hook `wp_ajax_wplm_activity_logs` was incorrectly pointing to a non-existent method.
- **Resolution:** Corrected the hook to point to the existing `ajax_get_activity_logs` method in `class-enhanced-admin-manager.php`.

### Issue 8: `PHP Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: Return value of WPLM_Activity_Logger::log() must be of type bool, null returned`
- **Description:** The `log` method in `class-activity-logger.php` was type-hinted to return a boolean, but `update_post_meta()` can return an integer.
- **Resolution:** Explicitly cast the return value of `update_post_meta()` to `bool`.

### Issue 9: `PHP Deprecated: Function get_page_by_title is deprecated`
- **Description:** Deprecated function usage.
- **Resolution:** Replaced `get_page_by_title` with `WP_Query` in `class-bulk-operations-manager.php` and `cli.php`.

### Issue 10: `PHP Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined method WPLM_Enhanced_API_Manager::validate_api_request()`
- **Description:** The `validate_api_request` method was missing.
- **Resolution:** Implemented the missing `validate_api_request` method in `class-enhanced-api-manager.php` to handle API key validation.

### Issue 11: `PHP Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot access offset of type string on string in /home/IciruNQiDZ9qc4ln/trynew/public_html/wp-content/plugins/wp-license-manager/includes/class-customer-management-system.php on line 787`
- **Description:** Error in `ajax_get_customers()` method due to incorrect array access. This often happens when `$_POST` or `$_GET` values are expected to be arrays but are strings.
- **Resolution:** The code will be examined to correctly handle array access, likely by ensuring that the variable being accessed is indeed an array before attempting to access it with an offset.

### Issue 12: `PHP Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined method WPLM_Notification_Manager::send_license_delivery_email() in /home/IciruNQiDZ9qc4ln/trynew/public_html/wp-content/plugins/wp-license-manager/includes/class-woocommerce-integration.php on line 347`
- **Description:** Critical error on the checkout page due to an undefined method call.
- **Resolution:** Implemented the `send_license_delivery_email()` method in `WPLM_Notification_Manager` and updated its call in `class-woocommerce-integration.php` to include the `$order` object.

### Issue 13: `PHP Notice: Function _load_textdomain_just_in_time was called incorrectly.`
- **Description:** Translation loading for the `wp-license-manager` domain was triggered too early, despite `load_plugin_textdomain_wplm()` being correctly hooked to the `init` action.
- **Resolution:** After thoroughly checking the WPLM plugin, the `load_plugin_textdomain` call within the plugin is correctly placed. This persistent notice is likely due to another plugin or the active theme incorrectly loading text domains. This is outside the scope of this plugin to fix, but it's acknowledged.

### Issue 14: `PHP Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot access offset of type string on string in /home/IciruNQiDZ9qc4ln/trynew/public_html/wp-content/plugins/wp-license-manager/includes/class-customer-management-system.php on line 787`
- **Description:** Error in `ajax_get_customers()` method due to incorrect array access on `$_POST['search']['value']`.
- **Resolution:** Modified `ajax_get_customers()` to safely retrieve the search term by checking if `$_POST['search']` is an array and if the `value` key exists before accessing it.

## Pending Tasks
- `final-ui-ux-review`: Final review and polish UI/UX for WPLM plugin.
- `polish-ui-ux`: Polish UI/UX and ensure all admin screens are complete in WPLM.
- `document-apis-hooks`: Document all REST API endpoints, hooks, and filters for WPLM developers.
