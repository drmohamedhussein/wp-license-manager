# WP License Manager (WPLM) Project Summary and Latest Updates

This document summarizes the development of the WP License Manager (WPLM) plugin, including its primary goals, key technical concepts, and a detailed log of all changes and bug fixes implemented during the current development session.

## 1. Primary Request and Intent

The user's primary goal is to create a robust, bug-free, and feature-rich WordPress licensing management system called WPLM. This plugin should:
- Serve as a full alternative to Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) and its licensing features.
- Integrate deeply with WooCommerce (while also being able to work standalone).
- Include a built-in CRM/ERM system.
- Have a licensing system similar to Elite Licenser.
- Support WooCommerce-style subscription licensing (like WooCommerce Subscriptions and EDD Recurring).
- Avoid critical errors and provide a smooth UI/UX.

The user provided reference files from EDD, its addons, Elite Licenser, and WooCommerce Subscriptions to aid in development. A comprehensive line-by-line recheck of the entire project was explicitly requested to improve code, look for bugs and errors, and fix everything.

**Project Phases:**
- **Phase 1: Core Licensing System & Product Management**
- **Phase 2: WooCommerce Integration**
- **Phase 3: CRM/ERM System**
- **Phase 4: REST API (Advanced & General)**

## 2. Key Technical Concepts

-   **WordPress Plugin Development:** Hooks (actions, filters), Custom Post Types (CPTs), Meta Boxes, AJAX handlers, WP-CLI integration, REST API, nonces, capability checks, input sanitization, output escaping, `wp_insert_post`, `wp_update_post`, `get_post_meta`, `update_post_meta`, `delete_post_meta`, `wp_send_json_success`, `wp_send_json_error`, `ob_start`/`ob_get_clean`.
-   **Licensing Management:** License key generation, activation/deactivation, activation limits, expiry dates, license statuses, domain validation, fingerprinting, remote kill switch, security incidents logging, rate limiting, license types.
-   **E-commerce Integration:** WooCommerce integration for products, orders, and subscriptions, ID-based product linking (`_wplm_wc_linked_wplm_product_id`, `_wplm_wc_product_id`).
-   **Subscription Management:** Built-in subscription system, WooCommerce Subscriptions integration, cron jobs for renewals and expiry checks, renewal reminders, AJAX-powered subscription creation modal.
-   **CRM/ERM:** Customer CPT, customer data syncing with WooCommerce, activity logging, communication log, customer import/export, AJAX-powered customer creation modal.
-   **Internationalization:** Text domain loading (`load_plugin_textdomain`).
-   **Error Handling & Debugging:** `WP_DEBUG`, `WP_DEBUG_LOG`, `dbDelta`, `wp_die`, `error_log`, `try-catch` blocks, `WP_Error`.
-   **PHP Features:** `ZipArchive` class, dynamic properties (PHP 8.2+ deprecation), `hash_equals`, `random_bytes`, `WP_Query` for database queries, `DOMDocument`, `SimpleXMLElement` for XML processing, `maybe_serialize`, `maybe_unserialize` for settings.
-   **Performance:** Efficient database queries, caching (transients).
-   **Frontend/UI:** DataTables.js for enhanced tables, Chart.js for analytics, Select2 for AJAX-powered dropdowns, custom modals, JavaScript event handling.

## 3. Latest Reported Issues & Fixes (Current Session)

The user reported several new issues, which have been addressed:

### Product Management Page
-   **Issue:** Mismatch between active and total licenses (active should count activations, not just status).
    -   **Fix:** Refactored `render_product_meta_box` in `class-enhanced-admin-manager.php` to correctly query and display "Total Licenses Generated" and "Currently Activated Licenses" based on actual activations.
-   **Issue:** WooCommerce product links are not showing/syncing correctly. Products with the same name in WPLM and WooCommerce are not differentiated or synced.
    -   **Fix:** Refactored `render_product_meta_box` to display a link to the associated WooCommerce product. Refactored `save_post_meta` to use ID-based linking for WooCommerce products, ensuring robust synchronization.

### Licenses Page
-   **Issue:** "Add New License" -> "Generate Key" button is not working and shows "An error occurred while generating the license key". The generated key should automatically become the post title.
    -   **Fix:** Refactored `ajax_generate_key` in `class-enhanced-admin-manager.php` to correctly handle both new and existing license posts, ensuring uniqueness, updating the post title, and returning the `license_key` and `post_id` via AJAX.

### Subscription Menu
-   **Issue:** "Create Subscription" button does not redirect, instead showing a small, unusable popup. Requires UI/CSS and redirection fixes.
    -   **Fix:** Implemented a generic modal container and a dedicated `render_create_subscription_modal_content` method in `class-enhanced-admin-manager.php`. Created AJAX endpoints (`wplm_render_create_subscription_form`, `wplm_search_customers`, `wplm_search_products`, `wplm_create_subscription`) and updated `enhanced-admin.js` to use these for a full-featured modal, handling form submission and enqueuing Select2.

### Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Page
-   **Issue:** "Add Customers" button has no action. It should create a comprehensive customer profile with details like username, names, country, mobile, social media links, and display associated products, licenses, and subscriptions, with or without WooCommerce sync.
    -   **Fix:** Implemented `render_create_customer_modal_content` in `class-enhanced-admin-manager.php`. Added AJAX endpoints (`wplm_render_create_customer_form`, `wplm_create_customer`) and localized a new nonce. Updated `enhanced-admin.js` to open this form in the generic modal and handle submission. Modified `ajax_get_customers()` in `class-customer-management-system.php` to safely retrieve search terms. Re-added missing `update_post_meta($customer_id, '_wplm_license_keys', []);` in `ajax_create_customer`.

### Activity Log
-   **Issue:** Still empty despite adding licenses, products, and customers.
    -   **Fix:** Refactored `ajax_get_activity_logs` in `class-enhanced-admin-manager.php` to correctly retrieve, filter, sort, and paginate activity logs from post meta across `wplm_license`, `wplm_product`, `wplm_customer`, and `wplm_subscription` post types. Updated `enhanced-admin.js` to include `toggleLogDetails` for expandable log entries.

### Import/Export Feature
-   **Issue:** Not working, redirects to an empty page, and crashes the website. Should generate an Excel file.
    -   **Fix:** Implemented all missing `generate_*_csv` and `get_*_data` methods in `class-import-export-manager.php` (for products, subscriptions, settings, activity logs). Refined `export_xml` to handle all data types. Implemented `import_setting` and `import_activity_log` (skipped direct import for logs). Refactored `process_import_data` to handle all data types. Enhanced `import_product` and `import_subscription` with comprehensive meta updates. Implemented `ajax_export_data`, `ajax_import_data`, and `ajax_validate_import` for robust AJAX-based import/export. Added a `class_exists('ZipArchive')` check in `export_csv`.

### Add Licenses/Bulk Licenses
-   **Issue:** Needs AJAX search for products.
    -   **Fix:** Implemented `ajax_search_products()` in `class-enhanced-admin-manager.php` to handle AJAX requests for `wplm_product` posts for Select2 dropdowns. Updated `enhanced-admin.js` to include `initSelect2()` for `.wplm-select2-product-search` and `.wplm-select2-customer-search` elements, ensuring AJAX search works across multiple forms, including the bulk license creation form.

### Generate Licenses from WooCommerce Orders Page
-   **Issue:** "Scan orders" button shows "Error scanning orders".
    -   **Fix:** Implemented `ajax_scan_wc_orders` and `ajax_generate_wc_licenses` in `class-bulk-operations-manager.php`. Updated `enhanced-admin.js` to add event listeners for the 'Scan Orders' and 'Generate Licenses' buttons, implementing frontend logic for AJAX requests, displaying results, and handling errors. Added new localization strings for these features.

### Bulk Operations
-   **Issue:** Needs a full review and rebuild with advanced options.
    -   **Fix:** Refactored `render_bulk_create_section` in `class-bulk-operations-manager.php` to use Select2 for AJAX product and customer search, passing `product_id` and `customer_id` (integers) in `ajax_bulk_create_licenses`. Updated `bulk-operations.js` to initialize Select2 for these fields and correctly retrieve their values. Added AJAX hooks for new bulk operations: `wplm_bulk_set_expiry`, `wplm_bulk_set_activation_limit`, `wplm_bulk_change_product`, `wplm_bulk_transfer_customer`, and `wplm_get_licenses_for_bulk`.

### Analytics
-   **Issue:** Activity report tab shows "No data available".
    -   **Fix:** Addressed by the refactoring of `ajax_get_activity_logs` (see Activity Log fix).

### Automatic Licenser System
-   **Issue:** Detailed request for a system to upload zip files, inject licensing templates/APIs, and create a production-ready licensed zip.
    -   **Status:** Pending.

### Elite Licenser Review
-   **Issue:** Re-check Elite Licenser files for relevant logic.
    -   **Status:** Pending.
