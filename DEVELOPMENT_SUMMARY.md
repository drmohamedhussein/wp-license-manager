# WordPress License Manager (WPLM) Development Summary

This document summarizes the development progress, issues encountered, fixes implemented, and ongoing tasks for the WPLM plugin. The primary goal is to create a robust, bug-free, and feature-rich WordPress licensing management system as a full alternative to Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) and its licensing features, with deep integration with WooCommerce, a built-in CRM/ERM system, and a licensing system similar to Elite Licenser.

## 1. Overall Vision and Phases

The project is structured into several phases:

*   **Phase 1: Core Licensing System & Product Management**
*   **Phase 2: WooCommerce Integration**
*   **Phase 3: CRM/ERM System**
*   **Phase 4: REST API (Advanced & General)**

The ultimate aim is a production-ready project with a smooth UI/UX, WooCommerce-style subscription licensing, and no critical errors.

## 2. Key Technical Concepts Involved

*   **WordPress Plugin Development:** Hooks (actions, filters), Custom Post Types (CPTs), Meta Boxes, AJAX handlers, WP-CLI, REST API, nonces, capability checks, input sanitization, output escaping.
*   **Licensing Management:** Key generation, activation/deactivation, limits, expiry dates, statuses, domain validation, fingerprinting, remote kill switch, logging, rate limiting.
*   **E-commerce Integration:** WooCommerce integration (products, orders, subscriptions), ID-based product linking.
*   **Subscription Management:** Built-in system, WooCommerce Subscriptions integration, cron jobs, renewal reminders.
*   **CRM/ERM:** Customer CPT, data syncing, activity logging, customer import/export.
*   **Error Handling & Debugging:** `WP_DEBUG`, `WP_DEBUG_LOG`, `WP_Error`, `try-catch`.
*   **PHP Features:** `ZipArchive`, `hash_equals`, `random_bytes`, `WP_Query`, `DOMDocument`, `json_decode`, CSV/XML handling.
*   **Performance:** Efficient database queries, caching.
*   **Frontend/UI:** DataTables.js, Chart.js, Select2, custom modals.

## 3. Issues Encountered and Fixes Implemented

Below is a detailed list of reported issues and their resolutions:

### 3.1. Critical Errors and Notices

*   **`PHP Fatal error: Call to undefined function add_query_var()`**
    *   **Diagnosis:** `add_query_var()` was called too early in `class-enhanced-digital-downloads.php`. The hook `query_vars` is the correct place to register query variables.
    *   **Fix:** Removed `add_query_var` from `setup_rewrite_rules()` and added `add_filter('query_vars', [$this, 'register_query_vars']);` in the constructor of `WPLM_Enhanced_Digital_Downloads` to call a new public method `register_query_vars($vars)` which handles query variable registration correctly.
*   **`PHP Notice: Function _load_textdomain_just_in_time was called incorrectly.`**
    *   **Diagnosis:** `load_plugin_textdomain()` was called too early.
    *   **Fix:** Changed `load_plugin_textdomain_wplm()` to `public` and explicitly hooked it to the `init` action with a default priority in `wp-license-manager.php`. This notice is now considered non-critical and external to the plugin's core logic.
*   **`PHP Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: call_user_func_array(): Argument #1 ($callback) must be a valid callback, cannot access private method WP_License_Manager::load_plugin_textdomain_wplm()`**
    *   **Diagnosis:** The `load_plugin_textdomain_wplm()` method was `private`, making it inaccessible to WordPress's hook system.
    *   **Fix:** Changed the visibility of `load_plugin_textdomain_wplm()` to `public` in `wp-license-manager/wp-license-manager.php`.
*   **`PHP Deprecated: Creation of dynamic property WPLM_Enhanced_Digital_Downloads::$payment_gateways is deprecated`**
    *   **Diagnosis:** Dynamic property creation is deprecated in PHP 8.2+.
    *   **Fix:** Explicitly declared the `$payment_gateways` property in the `WPLM_Enhanced_Digital_Downloads` class.
*   **`PHP Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: call_user_func_array(): Argument #1 ($callback) must be a valid callback, class WPLM_Enhanced_Admin_Manager does not have a method "ajax_activity_logs"`**
    *   **Diagnosis:** Incorrect AJAX hook mapping.
    *   **Fix:** Corrected the `wp_ajax_wplm_activity_logs` hook to point to the existing `ajax_get_activity_logs` method in `class-enhanced-admin-manager.php`.
*   **`PHP Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: Return value of WPLM_Activity_Logger::log() must be of type bool, null returned`**
    *   **Diagnosis:** Type mismatch in `WPLM_Activity_Logger::log()`.
    *   **Fix:** Explicitly cast the return value of `update_post_meta()` to `bool` in `WPLM_Activity_Logger::log()`.
*   **`PHP Deprecated: Function get_page_by_title is deprecated`**
    *   **Diagnosis:** Usage of a deprecated WordPress function.
    *   **Fix:** Replaced `get_page_by_title` with `WP_Query` for checking post uniqueness in `class-bulk-operations-manager.php` and `cli.php`.
*   **`PHP Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined method WPLM_Enhanced_API_Manager::validate_api_request()`**
    *   **Diagnosis:** Missing `validate_api_request` method implementation.
    *   **Fix:** Implemented the `validate_api_request` method in `class-enhanced-api-manager.php` to handle API key validation.
*   **`PHP Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined method WPLM_Notification_Manager::send_license_delivery_email()`**
    *   **Diagnosis:** Missing `send_license_delivery_email` method.
    *   **Fix:** Implemented `send_license_delivery_email()` in `class-notification-manager.php` and updated its call in `class-woocommerce-integration.php`.
*   **`PHP Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot access offset of type string on string in .../class-customer-management-system.php`**
    *   **Diagnosis:** Unsafe access to `$_POST['search']['value']`.
    *   **Fix:** Added checks `isset($_POST['search']) && is_array($_POST['search']) && isset($_POST['search']['value'])` before accessing `$_POST['search']['value']` in `ajax_get_customers()`.

### 3.2. Feature-Specific Bugs & Enhancements

*   **Product Management Page: Mismatch between active and total licenses; WooCommerce product links not showing/syncing.**
    *   **Fix:** Refactored `render_product_meta_box` in `class-enhanced-admin-manager.php` to query associated `wplm_license` posts, calculate active/total licenses correctly, and display WooCommerce product links. `save_post_meta`, `sync_woocommerce_to_wplm`, and `create_wplm_product_from_wc` were updated to use ID-based linking.
*   **Licenses Page: "Add New License" -> "Generate Key" button not working.**
    *   **Fix:** Refactored `ajax_generate_key` in `class-enhanced-admin-manager.php` to correctly generate unique license keys, update post titles, and return `license_key` and `post_id` via AJAX.
*   **Subscription Menu: "Create Subscription" button shows small, unusable popup.**
    *   **Fix:** Implemented generic modal, `render_create_subscription_modal_content`, and AJAX endpoints (`wplm_render_create_subscription_form`, `wplm_search_customers`, `wplm_search_products`, `wplm_create_subscription`) in `class-enhanced-admin-manager.php`. `enhanced-admin.js` was updated for modal handling, form submission, and Select2 integration.
*   **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Page: "Add Customers" button has no action.**
    *   **Fix:** Implemented `render_create_customer_modal_content` in `class-enhanced-admin-manager.php` and AJAX endpoints (`wplm_render_create_customer_form`, `wplm_create_customer`). `enhanced-admin.js` was updated to open the form in the generic modal and handle submission. `auto_create_customer_from_license` was fixed to append new license keys for existing customers.
*   **Activity Log: Still empty.**
    *   **Fix:** Refactored `ajax_get_activity_logs` in `class-enhanced-admin-manager.php` to aggregate activity logs from `_wplm_activity_log` post meta across `wplm_license`, `wplm_product`, `wplm_customer`, and `wplm_subscription` CPTs. `enhanced-admin.js` was updated for expandable log details.
*   **Import/Export Feature: Not working, redirects to empty page, crashes website.**
    *   **Fix:** Implemented all missing `generate_*_csv` and `get_*_data` methods (`products`, `subscriptions`, `settings`, `activity_logs`). Refined `export_xml` to handle all data types. Implemented `import_setting` and enhanced `import_product`, `import_subscription`. Refactored `process_import_data`. Implemented `ajax_export_data`, `ajax_import_data`, and `ajax_validate_import`.
*   **Add Licenses/Bulk Licenses: Needs AJAX search for products.**
    *   **Fix:** Refactored `render_licenses_page` and `render_bulk_create_section` to use `wplm-select2-product-search` class on product dropdowns. Implemented `ajax_search_products` endpoint in `class-enhanced-admin-manager.php`. `enhanced-admin.js` and `bulk-operations.js` were updated to initialize Select2 for product and customer search.
*   **Generate Licenses from WooCommerce Orders Page: "Scan orders" button shows "Error scanning orders".**
    *   **Fix:** Implemented `ajax_scan_wc_orders` and `ajax_generate_wc_licenses` in `class-bulk-operations-manager.php` to correctly scan orders for licensed products and generate licenses. `enhanced-admin.js` was updated with frontend logic for these operations.
*   **Bulk Operations: Needs a full review and rebuild with advanced options.**
    *   **Ongoing Task:** Started refactoring `render_bulk_manage_section` to include advanced filtering (status, product, customer, expiry date ranges) and new bulk actions (set expiry, set activation limit, change product, transfer customer).

## 4. Current Work & Next Steps

I have just completed updating the `render_bulk_manage_section` method in `wp-license-manager/includes/class-bulk-operations-manager.php` to include advanced filtering options (status, product, customer, expiry date ranges) and new bulk action buttons for setting expiry dates, activation limits, changing products, and transferring licenses to customers. Select2 integration for product and customer filters has also been added.

**Next, I will proceed with:**

1.  **Backend AJAX Handlers**: Develop the necessary AJAX endpoints in `class-bulk-operations-manager.php` to process these new advanced bulk actions (set expiry, set activation limit, change product, transfer customer).
2.  **Frontend JavaScript**: Update `bulk-operations.js` to manage the new UI elements, handle the advanced filtering, and send AJAX requests for the expanded bulk actions.
3.  **Review `bulk-operations.js`**: Re-evaluate the existing JavaScript logic for bulk operations to ensure compatibility with new features and improve overall user experience.
4.  **Polish UI/UX**: Ensure all admin screens related to bulk operations are complete and provide a smooth user experience.

## 5. Pending Tasks (from TODO list)

*   `review-bulk-operations`: Conduct a full review and rebuild of bulk operations for advanced options and ease of use. (Partially completed, but still ongoing with advanced actions).
*   `fix-analytics-activity-report`: Fix 'No data available' on the Analytics activity report tab.
*   `implement-auto-licenser-system`: Implement the Automatic Licenser System for non-developers: upload/extract zip, inject licensing template/API, create licensed zip.
*   `review-elite-licenser-files`: Review Elite Licenser files from the main directory to extract relevant logic for comparison and implementation.
*   `final-ui-ux-review`: Final review and polish UI/UX for WPLM plugin.
*   `polish-ui-ux`: Polish UI/UX and ensure all admin screens are complete in WPLM.
*   `document-apis-hooks`: Document all REST API endpoints, hooks, and filters for WPLM developers.
